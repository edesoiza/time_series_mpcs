# time_series_mpcs

This is a collection of notes from when I took UChicago's MPCS 58020 - Time Series Analysis and Stochastic Processes

I will not claim for this to be my original work although I did synthesize it into these notes. A lot of this content is pulled from textbooks as well as my professor's lectures.

Enjoy!
